# YOLOv8 Object Detection, Tracking, and Gender Classification

## Overview

This project leverages the powerful YOLOv8 model to implement real-time object detection, object tracking, and object classification. The primary objective is to detect objects, track their movements, and classify their gender (male or female) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### Key Features

- **Object Detection**: Using YOLOv8, one of the most advanced deep learning models for real-time object detection.
- **Object Tracking**: Tracks detected objects across frames to maintain consistent identification.
- **Gender Classification**: A custom CNN is employed to classify detected objects as male or female based on their features.
